## Create custom experiences

### Mod

One option could be a mod. A mod is a collection of files that can be added to a game to modify it. Mods can be created by anyone with the right tools and skills.
Mods can be installed on PCs, but also on mobile devices, consoles and even on the web.
The mods are sandboxed, so they can't access the system or other mods.

### Server

Another option could be a server. A server is a computer that is connected to the internet and can be accessed by other computers.
A server can be used to host the game. To add custom content to the game, the server can send mods to the players.
