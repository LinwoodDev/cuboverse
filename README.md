## Create custom experiences

### Mod

New blocks and items can be added through. A mod is a collection of files that can be added to a game to modify it. Mods can be created by anyone with the right tools and skills.
Mods can be installed on PCs, but also on mobile devices, consoles and even on the web.
The mods are sandboxed, so they can't access the system or other mods.

### Server

To use the mods you can have a server. A server is a computer that is connected to the internet and can be accessed by other computers.
A server can be used to host the game. To add custom content to the game, the server can send mods to the players.

### Local

To allow using mods offline and without server, mods can be installed locally.
Under the hood, a local server is started to host the game and the mods.
